##WORD COUNT SAMPLE APPLICATION
This application will create a tree from words in which each letter becomes an actor. Each complete word  will be given a counter and this counter is incremented for each instance of that word in the text. It is possible to search for the most frequent words in the text.

The app is used to simulate a lot of actor creation and also traversing these actors to create a load of the system.

###To Run
From command line directly:

	> sbt "run <textfile> <numberOfSearchesToPerform> <numberOfWordsToFind>"
	
or from inside sbt:

	> sbt
	> run <<textfile> <numberOfSearchesToPerform> <numberOfWordsToFind>
